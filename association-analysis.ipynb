This makes sense since people who purchase light cream are careful about what they eat hence they are more likely to buy chicken i.e. white meat instead of red meat i.e. beef. Or this could mean that light cream is commonly used in recipes for chicken.\n","\n","The support value for the first rule is 0.0045. This number is calculated by dividing the number of transactions containing light cream divided by total number of transactions. The confidence level for the rule is 0.2905 which shows that out of all the transactions that contain light cream, 29.05% of the transactions also contain chicken. Finally, the lift of 4.84 tells us that chicken is 4.84 times more likely to be bought by the customers who buy light cream compared to the default likelihood of the sale of chicken.\"\n","\n","From
